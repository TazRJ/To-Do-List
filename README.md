**Tech used:** EJS/HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.Js, Express, MongoDB Atlas

This project is a to-do list web application that can perform all essential CRUD operations!

It uses Node.js and Express for the back end, and vanilla JS/CSS with a EJS templating engine for the front end. 

The goal of this project was to experiment and develop my personal coding abilty and understanding of full-stack web development
